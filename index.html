                 <p>In an age where Shooting is dominated by affluent and fortunate persons like Abhinav Bindra who can afford an indoor shooting range at his home and RajyaVardhan Singh Rathore who comes from a decorated family of Colonels and Brigadiers (no disrespect to their talent), it is inspiring to hear the story of Ravi Varma, someone who had no background but holds his head high with his exemplary performances at the national level.</p>
                 <p>Ravi Varma’s family is settled in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. His father, Venkatesh, is a tailor; and mother, Vijaya, is a housewife. He also has a sister who is pursuing her B. Ed. His father’s daily wages are the only source of income in his family. His parents provided as much as they could for their childrens’ schooling, and college. </p>

                 <p>First time I met Ravi was 10 years ago, both of us looking for an admission into a school in Bhimavaram, a town in Andhra Pradesh. Even at that age, he has shown great skill and talent in sports. While in school, he has participated and achieved at district and state levels in various sports including Hockey, Football, Kho Kho, and athletics. Talent is one aspect of him, but he attributes most of this success to his practice, hard work, and ‘Never-give-up’ attitude. He spent a lot of his time training on the ground, constantly working on his improvement.</p>
                 <p>During diploma, he followed his passion for sports and represented his college at various tournaments in Football and Athletics. But after his diploma, as it often occurs in India, he could find a career in sports. He has taken up a job in a BPO company and later worked as a Field Engineer to support his family. While still working he stumbled into the sport of pistol shooting, thanks to a friend, and within a short while he recognized his skill in the game.</p>
                 <p>He had to manage the practice expenses while supporting his family with a minimal income of Rs 10000. The reason for Shooting to be exclusive to the wealthy section is that everything that goes into the sport is expensive: Training, pistol, Gear, and pellets etc. He did not have the opportunity to practice as much as the other players because the costs are proportional to the level of practice. A very good friend and training partner at practice helped Ravi by lending his Pistol for practice and for tournaments.</p>


                 <p>Yet, with all these tough circumstances, he was able to shine under pressure and has quite a few achievements to his name:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>2nd Place in 10m Air pistol, Hubli Shooting Championship 2018, Karnataka</li>
                    <li>Selected for Indian Trails, 10 meter Air Pistol, National Shooting Championship 2017, Kerala</li>
                    <li>8th place in senior men 10m Air Pistol, G. V. Mavalankar shooting championship 2017, Mumbai</li>
                  </ul>

                </p>
                <p>One of the hardest challenges he faced is to find the funds to train, practice and to travel to the tournament venues. His friends have supported him through this journey of ups and downs, but since he started competing at National level, he needs to get at least a decent weapon to outperform the others. His basic requirements now include:<br>
